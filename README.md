# MATLAB Engine API for Python

The MATLAB&reg; Engine API for Python&reg; provides a package to integrate MATLAB functionality directly with a Python application, creating an interface to call functions from your MATLAB installation from Python code.

## Install

### Windows
MATLAB Engine API for Python can be installed directly from the Python Package Index.
<!-- MUST_BE_UPDATED_EACH_RELEASE (Search repo for this string) -->
```bash
$ python -m pip install matlabengine==9.13.5
```



### Linux&reg; 
Prior to installation, check the default install location of MATLAB by calling ```matlabroot``` in a MATLAB Command Window. By default, Linux installs MATLAB at:<br>
<!-- MUST_BE_UPDATED_EACH_RELEASE (Search repo for this string) -->
```/usr/local/MATLAB/R2022b```

When MATLAB is not installed in the default location, the bin/*architecture* directory within the MATLAB root directory must be added to an environment variable. The path can be added to the environment variable within the shell startup configuration file (for example, .bashrc for bash shell or .tcshrc for tcsh).

```bash
# in .bashrc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64
```

```bash
# in .tcshrc
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64
```

MATLAB Engine API for Python can be installed directly from the Python Package Index.
<!-- MUST_BE_UPDATED_EACH_RELEASE (Search repo for this string) -->
```bash
$ python -m pip install matlabengine==9.13.5
```

### macOS
Prior to installation, check the default install location of MATLAB by calling ```matlabroot``` in a MATLAB Command Window. By default, macOS installs MATLAB at:<br>

<!-- MUST_BE_UPDATED_EACH_RELEASE (Search repo for this string) -->
```/Applications/MATLAB_R2022b.app```

When MATLAB is not installed in the default location, the bin/*architecture* directory within the MATLAB root directory must be added to an environment variable. The path can be added to the environment variable within the shell startup configuration file (for example, .bashrc for bash shell or .tcshrc for tcsh).

```bash
# in .bashrc
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:<matlabroot>/bin/maci64
```

```bash
# in .tcshrc
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<matlabroot>/bin/maci64
```

## Getting Started
* Start Python.
* Import the ```matlab.engine``` package into the Python session.
* Start a new MATLAB process by calling ```start_matlab```. The ```start_matlab``` function returns a Python object which enables you to pass data and call functions executed by MATLAB.

```python
>>> import matlab.engine
>>> eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
>>> eng.sqrt(4.0)
2.0
```

* Call either the ```exit``` or ```quit``` function to stop the engine. Exiting Python with an engine running stops the engine and its MATLAB processes.

```python
>>> eng.quit()
```

See [Start and Stop MATLAB Engine for Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/start-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html) for advanced startup examples.

## Examples
You can call any MATLAB function directly and return the results to Python. 
```python
>>> eng.plus(2, 3)
5
>>> eng.isprime(37)
True
>>> eng.gcd(100.0, 80.0, nargout=3)
(20.0, 1.0, -1.0)
```
See [Call MATLAB Functions from Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/call-matlab-functions-from-python.html) for more usage examples.
